                            Currently, the number of young people who do not clearly know what professional and work career to start
                             after completing their school studies it is very low and according to studies around 70% of
                             Students graduate from their schools without receiving adequate vocational guidance. This problem
                             It is one of the most influential factors in university dropout and there are very few applications
                             competent to provide a solution to the problem raised. It is for this reason that Wissen was born, a
                             mobile application that will provide comprehensive services for vocational guidance and support of
                             young people in the tenth and eleventh grades of the city of Bogotá.

                                                For the structuring of the website, the arrangement of the brand's corporate colors, the
                                                 which tried to stand out with a color proposal that was adverse to other applications within the
                                                 mobile applications focused on education. Based on this, a main layout was generated with a bar
                                                 navigation, a structured environment with different scrolls within the main blocks of information;
                                                 allowing you to maximize what is available in a dynamic and simple way. All this allowed us to present the information
                                                 holistically without generating friction within the arrangements of the information and objects presented,
                                                 within each segment.

                                                Within the layouts of the page, justification parameters, color palette and typography were used.
                                                 homogeneous, which allowed us to have an identity and coherence within the design of the website. Having

                                                 and points of interaction with the user. The delimitation of the contents according to the visualization was kept in mind
                                                 of the users and devices used to view the contents; whether web, tablet or smartphone.

                                                In addition to being an appropriate font to display information, it allows us to have easy reading of the information.
                                                and thanks to the two intervals within the weight of the typography we can define guidelines within each section, which
                                                allows better compression for the reader.

                                                The structure of the website in its essence is composed of a purely academic approach, where the design and its
                                                 Information visualization is defined by Wissen's value proposition. However, although the proposal
                                                 The design is aligned with the vision and mission, in this case greater relevance is given to the information within the website.

                                                To support the present information, some mockups were made to complete the brand image, where the provisions
                                                 Within the design of the website, be complementary with graphic samples that reinforce the visual of the brand within
                                                 the page and in turn generate new dynamics to present the information.

                                                 The segmentation of information throughout the Wissen website is one of the fundamental components, since the
                                                 Information was structured by functional segments where the general order was respected, the relevance of the information
                                                 It was taken according to the functional positioning and the data were homogeneously united with the visual resources.
                                                 <br></br>
                                                 Being differentiating within the market and having similar functional characteristics were base components for the
                                                 structuring of segments within the website; since the relevance of each component depended on familiarity
                                                 of users with the mechanisms in place.

                                                Within the mechanisms created for the website, the “Pre-Beta” section was implemented. Which will allow the

                                                 mechanism will be stored within SQL databases in text formats. This integration, although it was implemented in the

                                                 tools and their respective connection with the database.
