                            Eco Bamboo Toilet was born at the end of 2020 through the entrepreneurial idea of a group of university students who were looking for
                             of new business opportunities saw it pertinent to delve into one of the problems that most afflicts
                             to the world today; which is the pollution of non-recyclable plastics. Eco bamboo through
                             production of dispensers and refillable containers that are manufactured from a base derived from bamboo fibers,
                             aims to mitigate the consequences of single-use plastics.

                                    For the creation of the logo, the natural fibers of bamboo are taken as a structural precedent as a base in the
                                     design composition. To do this, a 45° base grid is established, the typography “Poppins, sans-serif” as
                                     initial basis of the modeling and the palette designed for this brand composed of the three base colors of this
                                     composition. By having these basic components, the brand is structured using the Poppins font. Without
                                     However, it is only a basis for the initial modeling, which would later be diagrammed with a larger image.
                                     minimalist, clean and friendly.
                                    <br></br>
                                    The color arrangement within the logo is arranged by a linear gradient, in which an emphasis was placed
                                     in the two main colors of the palette. Maintained a solid color in the first two words and a gradient
                                     linear in the other two words; This allowed generating a color contrast within the design, generating a
                                     differentiation and visual strength between the elements of the logo.

                                    The colors selected for the design proposal are influenced by the colors of bamboo and
                                     their intervals, within a proposal that would reflect the identity of “Aseo Eco Bambú”. That is why it is taken
                                     bamboo, one of the main components within the “Aseo Eco Bambú” products as a driving axis
                                     between the meaning per se and its qualities as a flexible and ecological material.
                                    <br></br>
                                    The color palette used within the design is structured by three colors, which are
                                     located within a color range. Mainly composed of a green color palette as the protagonist,
                                     which evokes tranquility, nature and ecology. In addition to a chromatic composition that interspersed the color
                                     main with the others, which allowed us a homogeneous arrangement between the other colors of the palette.

                                    dry stick, which allows us to evoke an effect of modernity, minimalism, cleanliness and above all allow easy
                                    visualization of information. Being a source with 5 different weights, it allows us to vary the strength and
                                    intensity of what we transmit. That is why, for the design proposal, Poppins Bold, Black was used
                                    and Medium. For the initial layouts of the logo sketch and for the consequent reorganizations of the
                                    content and information within the design of the proposal.

                                    Keeping in mind the provisions already established within the brand design, some archetypes are made
                                     that complete the “Eco Bambú Toilet” proposal. That is why two prototypes are modeled that represent the
                                     initial brand proposal; in which its ergonomics, design, replication in a process were taken into account
                                     productive and its environmental impact.

								<p>
                                    By establishing two prototypes for the “Eco Bambú Toilet” proposal. It is defined that the design, although it will be simple;
                                     It will be focused on being a functional product that is easy to use for those who produce it and friendly for those who produce it.
                                     uses in your daily life. For this reason, the two proposed models have characteristics that evoke the identity of
                                     the brand, without overloading the product with graphic references.

                                    By prioritizing functionality and having a sober and minimalist design. There was greater scope for
                                     the presentation of “Aseo Eco Bambú” as a brand within the market. All this leads to the fact that the brand, as per se
                                     has a greater margin to express its value proposition, something that was wanted to be visualized through the different

                                     productive visual and in a commercial one. As a second instance, a general structure where several samples are displayed
                                     in the visual of the brand and, finally, a somewhat disparate sample of the visual identity of the brand, but at the same time
                                     complementary with the other samples.
                                     Within the Mockus created for the brand, three proposals were focused with different parameters from each other, but
