                            I was working on the development of a complete dashboard for Cenit, a leading company in hydrocarbon transportation and 
                            logistics, using exclusively Power BI. Working closely with the client, I began by gathering their specific requirements 
                            and designing the conceptual outline of the dashboard, identifying key metrics and essential functionalities to provide 
                            a comprehensive view of the company's operations.

								<p>
                                    I then proceeded to develop the dashboard using Power BI capabilities to effectively integrate and visualize data, 
                                    ensuring the interface was intuitive and easy to use. Conducted extensive testing to ensure accuracy and efficiency 
                                    of the dashboard, adjusting the design based on customer feedback to meet customer expectations. Once the project 
                                    was completed and approved, I proceeded to implement and deploy the dashboard in a production environment, 
                                    guaranteeing its availability for daily use by Cenit users.

                                    During the initial analysis, we observed that in 2021 there were fewer developments compared to previous years, 
                                    suggesting a possible slowdown or stagnation in certain areas of the company. However, in 2022, we notice a 
                                    significant increase in the number of new developments compared to the previous year. This increase could indicate 
                                    a period of growth or renewed activity within the company, possibly driven by new projects, initiatives or strategies 
                                    implemented during that period. It is important to dig deeper into the data and explore the underlying causes behind 
                                    these changes to better understand how they impact the overall operation of the business and determine any actions 
                                    or adjustments necessary to optimize future performance.

                                    During the initial analysis, we identified that the F319 category count was the highest, with a total of 6 incidents 
                                    recorded. Likewise, categories F412 and N23 showed a considerably high number of incidents, with 5 records each. On 
                                    the other hand, the other data were distributed in a range of 4 to 1 incidents, which indicates a variety in the 
                                    frequency of the different categories of news. This analysis provides us with an initial understanding of the focus 
                                    areas and potential trends within the reported incidents, which will allow us to investigate further and take appropriate 
                                    action as necessary to address the identified issues.

                                    During the analysis, we observed that the count of the number of days for the novelty to be recovered showed a significant 
                                    variation between the different entities. Sanitas EPS recorded the highest number of days, with a total of 83 days for the 
                                    novelty to be recovered, followed by Fosyga with 32 days. On the other hand, Aliansalud EPS and Nueva EPS presented a total 
                                    of 16 days each, while EPS Sura reported 7 days. The other entities were located in an interval that ranged between 4 and 1 
                                    day. This information allows us to identify differences in collection times between different entities, which could be 
                                    indicative of efficiency in internal processes or possible areas of improvement in the management of developments. It is 
                                    important to further investigate the causes behind these disparities and take steps to optimize collection times to benefit 
                                    operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

                                    During the analysis, it was found that the number of days for the novelty to be recovered showed a varied distribution among 
                                    the different entities. Sanitas EPS represented the largest share with 53.59% of the total, followed by Fosyga with 20.77%. 
                                    Aliansalud EPS and Nueva EPS had 9.34% each, while EPS Sura had 4.12%. The other entities were distributed in a range that 
                                    oscillated between 1.17% and 2.91%. This visualization in a pie diagram allows a quick understanding of the relative participation 
                                    of each entity in the total days of newness to be recovered, highlighting the importance of Sanitas EPS in this aspect and 
                                    providing a clear perspective of how recovery times are distributed between the different entities.

                                    During the analysis, it was observed that the administration name count showed an uneven distribution among the different entities. 
                                    Sanitas EPS topped the list with 12 registrations, followed by Fosyga with 11. Nueva EPS reported 8 registrations, EPS Sura had 
                                    2 registrations, while the other stocks were presented at 1 registration each. This information highlights the predominance of 
                                    Sanitas EPS and Fosyga in the number of registrations, possibly indicating a greater frequency of operations or interactions with 
                                    these entities compared to others. It is important to consider this distribution when conducting more detailed analyzes of activities 
                                    and relationships within the context of management.
